The approach of EN ISO 13849-1, however, offers users the facility for developing and evaluating safety functions, ranging from a sensor to an actuator (e.g. a valve), under the umbrella of one standard, even though the functions may involve different technologies. Part 1 of EN ISO 13849 is accompa - nied by a Part 2 with the title of “Validation”.",rep0217e.pdf (Score: 0.69)
